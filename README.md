#### PLANNING: Center for multi-sectoral decision analytics for optimizing health outcomes  
The centerâ€™s goal is to advance fundamental analytics and translational research to develop models for coordinated analyses of multi-sectoral decisions related to health across the lifespan, health equity, and social determinants. Decision analytic models play a key role in informing decisions at both public agency and community care-provider levels. The typical silos approach to single-disease decision analyses leads to suboptimal decisions, as they overlook correlations between diseases and social determinants, and the mechanisms leading to co-occurrence of multiple diseases. The envisioned transformative shift to multi-sectoral decision analyses is a complex challenge that cannot be achieved through fragmented independent research projects. 

The planning phase will focus on developing a systematic approach for development, coordination, and integration of activities along the pipeline of data to decisions, through convergent fundamental and translational research, workforce development, inclusion, and innovation. This work is a collaborative effort between multidisciplinary researchers and partners from academic and non-academic institutes.
